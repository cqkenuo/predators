The hare was once boasting of his speed before the other animals.
 “I have never been beaten,” he said, “when I run at full speed, no one is faster than me.”
The tortoise said quietly, “I will race with you.” 
“That is a good joke,” said the hare. 
“I could dance around you the whole way.”
The race started. The hare darted almost out of sight at once. 
He soon stopped and lay down to have a nap.
The tortoise plodded on and on. When the hare awoke from his nap,
 he saw the tortoise was near the finish line, 
 and that he had lost the race.
